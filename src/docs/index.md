# ${document.title}

The simple way to create/increment a project buildNumber.

## Work in progress
I am making some improvements to the internals, plus a few interface changes.

When done I will be releasing it as version 2 as it will not be backwards compatible.


## Current release - v1.0
This is the first release of this project.  I hope that you find it both robust as well as useful.

Currently, I have not uploaded it into the Maven repository, so you will have to download it from here
and install it locally.  Once I have tidied up some non-critical aspects of the project, I will
research into doing that.
