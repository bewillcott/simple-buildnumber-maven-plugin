            <h1>Simple BuildNumber Maven Plugin</h1>

<p>The simple way to create/increment a project buildNumber.</p>

<h2>Work in progress</h2>

<p>I am making some improvements to the internals, plus a few interface changes.</p>

<p>When done I will be releasing it as version 2 as it will not be backwards compatible.</p>

<h2>Current release - v1.0</h2>

<p>This is the first release of this project.  I hope that you find it both robust as well as useful.</p>

<p>Currently, I have not uploaded it into the Maven repository, so you will have to download it from here
and install it locally.  Once I have tidied up some non-critical aspects of the project, I will
research into doing that.</p>
